# Intermediate-CSS---Stylished-Personal-Site
Welcome to my Intermediate CSS - Stylished Personal Site! My name is Thamizh Gnanam K S and I'm excited to showcase my skills in HTML and CSS through this website.
You will find an About Me section, a Skills section, and a Contact section, all designed with a modern and sleek look.

To achieve the layout and positioning of the elements on the page, I used the box model and float properties in CSS. The box model is the basic layout concept in CSS, which treats all elements as rectangular boxes. The float property allowed me to float the elements to either the left or right side of the page, creating a layout with multiple columns.

Although the mail button is not functional, you can still reach me through the contact form or by emailing me directly.

I am proud of the work I have accomplished thus far, and I am eager to continue building upon these skills as I progress in my journey as a web developer. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I hope you enjoy browsing through it!
